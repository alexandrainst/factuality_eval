## Why are LLMs not factual?

- LLMs do not know what they do not know, sometimes overestimate their capacities and
  confidently output unknown information, leading to false responses.

## The art of saying "I don't know"

(Check paper from Friday on multiple questionnaires, where it sometimes says it doesn't
know the answer.)

## Difficulties with evaluating factuality

- Studies assessing language models’ factuality or evaluating whether the methods are
  effective to mitigate model hallucinations use different datasets and metrics.
	- This makes it difficult to compare, in the same conditions, the factuality of
	  different models as well as to compare the effectiveness of different factuality
	  enhancement approaches.

## Research goals

- Hvad vil vi måle
- Hvilke metoder vil vi bruge
- Hvilke dataset er relevante

We don't really care about how factual the LLM's are, but we want to know can we trust
them. This means that we're not trying to test which LLM is most likeliy to win in
Jeapordy, however we are more interested in testing which one would lie or cheat in
Jeapordy. But at the same time, we do not want a metric that will be biased in a way
that the LLM always answers I dont know, and gets a good score for that.

## Challenges

Metric bias (**I. Augenstein, T. Baldwin, M. Cha, T. Chakraborty, G. L. Ciampaglia, D.
Corney, R. DiResta, E. Ferrara, S. Hale, A. Halevy et al., “Factuality challenges in the
era of large language models and opportunities for factchecking,” Nature Machine
Intelligence, vol. 6, no. 8, pp. 852–863, 2024.)**

Dependence on high quality annotated evidence datasets.

## Overall strategies

Using LLMs themselves as evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge). Often closely just as good as
humans.

RAG

Human evaluation

Detecting hallucinations in language models is challenging. There are three general
approaches:

- **Measuring token-level probability distributions** for indications that a model is
  “confused.” Though sometimes effective, these methods rely on model internals being
  accessible—which is often not the case when working with hosted LLMs.
- **Referencing external fact-verification systems**, like a database or document store.
  These methods are great for RAG-style use-cases, but they are only effective if you
  have a useful dataset and the infrastructure to use it.
- **Using LLM-as-a-judge techniques** to assess whether or not a model hallucinated.
  These techniques are becoming standard in the LLM ecosystem, but as I’ll explain
  throughout this piece, using them effectively requires a deceptive amount of work.

The problem with many LLM-as-a-Judge techniques is that they tend towards two
polarities: they are either too simple, using a basic zero-shot approach, or they are
wildly complex, involving multiple LLMs interacting via multi-turn reasoning.

## Datasets

- HotpotQA
- SimpleQA
- PersonQA (possibly not public)
- SQuAD

## Hallucination

### Definition of hallucinations

Hallucinations are a feature, not a bug. When is a LLM hallucinating, and when is it
creating?

### Hallucination theory

- Entropy measurements (need output probability distribution)
- Er der teoretisk grundlag for at man kan teste factuality?

### Hallucination detectors

- Paper: Not possible if trained only on correct samples (duh)
- SelfCheckGPT: Voting system

### SelfCheckGPT

Check for variance i output af ens model, er det meget stokastisk / random eller
konvergerer modellen mod det samme svar?
